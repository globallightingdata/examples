# GLDF, L3D & P3D examples

This repository contains various real-world luminaires created with the Global Lighting Data Format [gldf](https://gldf.io), Luminaire 3D Format [l3d](https://github.com/globallightingdata/l3d) and the Parametrical 3D Format (coming soon).

We will gradually expand the examples to help teach manufacturers and developers the best practices for building GLDF, L3D and P3D files.
